A data set of small molecules selected from QM7b data set, with formation energy. 

small_molecules-1000.xyz     xyz coordinates of the small molecules
design_matrix.txt                 design matrix (each row: features of each molecule)
design_matrix-missing-data.txt                 design matrix with about 1% missing data
design_matrix-pca-d10.txt                       low d projection of the design matrix
formation_energy.txt                  this is what we try to predict. The formation energy for each molecule
